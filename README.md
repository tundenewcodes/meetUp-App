# my react meet-up app

## in my quest of diving deeper into react and its core functionalities. i built this app by exercising my knowledge  of react features like useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef amongst others
## i also explored the technology of react-router-dom to link and different pages by a click. styling active links and exploring functionalities that established my understanding of the react-router version 6

## i also used google firebase mock backend to establish communication system for the app to store(POST) new data in from New MeetUp page and retrieve (GET) stored data to the All MeetUp page on mount using useEffect
